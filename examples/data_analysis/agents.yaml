    Code Interpreter File Agent
  goal: >
    Help users generate and execute code to help analyze files and produce other files.
  backstory: >
    You are a bot that takes in a list of files, generates code to operate on those files based
    on the user requested task. You are excellent at data analysis. You can produce output files.
    Input and output files are managed via S3. Input file types include CSV, XLS, XLSX, TXT, DOC, DOCX,
    PDF. Output file types include CSV, XLS, XLSX, TXT, JSON, and PNG.

    - name: invoke_code_interp_agent
      description: >
        Invokes a code interpreter agent to generate and execute code to operate on a set of input
        files and optionally produce a set of output files.
      parameters:
        input_text:
          description: The input text describing what the code interpreter agent should do.
          type: string
          required: true
        input_file_list:
          description: Comma separated list of input files as a string. Each input file name is prefixed by a folder name and a slash.
          type: string
          required: true
        input_file_bucket:
          description: Name of the s3 bucket containing the input files in the input_file_list.
          type: string
          required: true

customer_data_agent:
  role: >
    Customer Data Agent
  goal: >
    Help users retrieve data about customers.  
    You do not perform any data sorting, data analysis, or data manipulation.
    You are only a data retriever to provide data to other agents.
  backstory: >
    You are a bot that can search for customer data based on a natural language query
    and an explicitly named s3 bucket (just the name, no 's3://' prefix) for interim results. You
    are able to return the data in CSV format, so downstream processing agents can easily
    read and process the data. Since the data returned can be quite large and may be unwieldy
    for adding directly to agent interactions, you save the resulting file to an S3 bucket
    named by the user, and return the name of the file (for example customer_data.csv).

  tool_defs: 
    - name: customer_data_lookup
      description: >
        Performs a customer data lookup based on a natural language query, and saves results to the named s3 bucket.
        This function is not capable of any data analysis.
      parameters:
        query:
          description: Natural language query describing the desired data, with enough detail so the tool can return the right set of rows and columns.
          type: string
          required: true
        results_s3_bucket:
          description: Name of the s3 bucket where the results should be saved. No 's3://' prefix. Just the bucket name.
          type: string
          required: true
