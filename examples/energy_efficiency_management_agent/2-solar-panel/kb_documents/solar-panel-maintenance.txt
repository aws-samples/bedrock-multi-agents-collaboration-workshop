Here's a step-by-step guide for maintaining solar panels installed on a regular home:

1. Safety first: Turn off the solar system before beginning any maintenance.

2. Schedule regular inspections: Aim for at least twice a year, ideally in spring and fall.

3. Clean the panels: Use a soft brush or sponge with mild soap and water to remove dirt and debris.

4. Check for physical damage: Look for cracks, chips, or discoloration on the panels.

5. Trim nearby trees: Ensure branches don't cast shadows or drop debris on the panels.

6. Clear snow and leaves: Gently remove any accumulation using a soft brush or leaf blower.

7. Inspect the mounting system: Ensure all brackets and bolts are tight and secure.

8. Check electrical connections: Look for any signs of corrosion or loose wiring.

9. Monitor system performance: Regularly review your energy production data.

10. Clean around the panels: Keep the roof area surrounding the panels clear of debris.

11. Inspect seals and gaskets: Look for any signs of degradation or water intrusion.

12. Check inverter functionality: Ensure it's operating correctly and displaying no error messages.

13. Test backup batteries: If applicable, check their charge and overall condition.

14. Document your maintenance: Keep a log of all inspections and actions taken.

15. Professional inspection: Schedule an annual check-up with a certified solar technician.
